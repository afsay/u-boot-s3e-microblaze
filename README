This is a custom u-boot version to experiment with spartan 3e starter kit.

This branch is using from https://github.com/xilinx/u-boot-xlnx tag xilinx-v14.7 as reference.

Currently spartan 3e start kit can boot from u-boot without problem:

Serial device IO via UART, Interrupt handler, Timer initialization, GPIO access(accessing buttons and LEDs) are working.

Work in Progress:
	Ethernet needs testing.
	Flash memory access need further debugging.
